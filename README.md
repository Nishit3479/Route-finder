# Route-finder
A Java code for a Route finder using BFS and DFS

In the above program, the structure of a basic tree/map has been given which can be modified to take user inputs. Thus we will be able to get the route from a node to another node using BFS and DFS.
Further modifications can be made to assign real world places as nodes to make this work in real world.

Any queries/doubts regarding the code?
Feel free to ping me up any time. I will try to resolve it as soon as possible.
